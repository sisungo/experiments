## FAQ
**Q**: Will experiments keep experimental forever?

**A**: These projects will not be always experimental. Some experiments will be moved into a standalone repository when they
are no longer experimental.

**Q**: I see the commit messages are strange. Why?

**A**: In this repository, commit messages begin with `experiment: `, and the following is a sentence from motto or lyrics.

**Q**: Can I make an issue or PR for one of the experiments?

**A**: Yes.
